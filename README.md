# NBA-Draft-Biola-Summer-Research
This research was done in Summer 2022. The goal was to see if we could improve the current NBA's success rate of picking Draft players using Machine Learning.

What we accomplished:
using PIE, salary, and minutes as a measure we were able to "value" how well a player performed in their 5th year, where players sign out of their rookie contract. We showed that current NBA teams are doing not so hot in choosing draft picks and missing unicorns like Jimmy Butler and Jokic.

Our future goals is to implement a Machine Learning model that can predict and categorize if a player is a 'high' , 'med', or 'low' impact player. Our first model showed a 56% accuracy of categorizing a player and we seek to improve the model by fine tuning the input data.

The team was Timothy Lindsey who now attends UCLA for a masters in Bioinformatics, Genti Buzi who is the ML Professor @ Biola University, and Joseph Hartono a current CS student at Biola.
