# NBA-Draft Machine Learning Research
Goal: Improve the current NBA's success rate of picking Draft players using Machine Learning.

What we accomplished:
using PIE, salary, and minutes as a measure we were able to "value" how well a player performed in their 5th year, where players sign out of their rookie contract. Conclusion: NBA teams perform poorly in draft picking and miss unicorns like Jimmy Butler and Jokic.

Future Goal: Implement a Machine Learning model that can predict and categorize if a player is a 'high' , 'med', or 'low' impact player. Our first model showed a 56% accuracy of categorizing a player and we seek to improve the model by fine tuning the input data.

The team was Timothy Lindsey who now attends UCLA for a masters in Bioinformatics, Genti Buzi who is the ML Professor @ Biola University, and Joseph Hartono a current CS student at Biola.
